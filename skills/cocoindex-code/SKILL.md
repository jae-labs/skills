# ccc - Semantic Code Search & Indexing

`ccc` is the CLI for CocoIndex Code, providing semantic search over the current codebase and index management.

## Ownership

The agent owns the `ccc` lifecycle for the current project — initialization, indexing, and searching. Do not ask the user to perform these steps; handle them automatically.

- **Initialization**: If `ccc search` or `ccc index` fails with an initialization error (e.g., "Not in an initialized project directory"), run `ccc init` from the project root directory, then `ccc index` to build the index, then retry the original command.
- **Index freshness**: Keep the index up to date by running `ccc index` (or `ccc search --refresh`) when the index may be stale — e.g., at the start of a session, or after making significant code changes (new files, refactors, renamed modules). There is no need to re-index between consecutive searches if no code was changed in between.
- **Installation**: If `ccc` itself is not found (command not found), do not give up. Proceed to install it automatically using one of the following commands, then retry:
  - **Using pipx**:
    ```bash
    pipx install 'cocoindex-code[full]'          # batteries included (local embeddings)
    pipx upgrade cocoindex-code                  # upgrade
    ```
  - **Using uv**:
    ```bash
    uv tool install --upgrade 'cocoindex-code[full]'
    ```

## Searching the Codebase

To perform a semantic search:

```bash
ccc search <query terms>
```

The query should describe the concept, functionality, or behavior to find, not exact code syntax. For example:

```bash
ccc search database connection pooling
ccc search user authentication flow
ccc search error handling retry logic
```

### Filtering Results

- **By language** (`--lang`, repeatable): restrict results to specific languages.

  ```bash
  ccc search --lang python --lang markdown database schema
  ```

- **By path** (`--path`): restrict results to a glob pattern relative to project root. If omitted, defaults to the current working directory (only results under that subdirectory are returned).

  ```bash
  ccc search --path 'src/api/*' request validation
  ```

### Pagination

Results default to the first page. To retrieve additional results:

```bash
ccc search --offset 5 --limit 5 database schema
```

If all returned results look relevant, use `--offset` to fetch the next page — there are likely more useful matches beyond the first page.

### Working with Search Results

Search results include file paths and line ranges. To explore a result in more detail:

- Use the editor's built-in file reading capabilities (e.g., the `Read` tool) to load the matched file and read lines around the returned range for full context.
- When working in a terminal without a file-reading tool, use `sed -n '<start>,<end>p' <file>` to extract a specific line range.
